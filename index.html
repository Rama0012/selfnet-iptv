	<p>SelfStreaming is free IPTV by Selfnet, allowing you to legally watch TV on your computer (only available inside the Selfnet/WH-Netz intranet).

	<h2>In-Browser Stream List</h2>
	<p>The VLC browser plugin (comes with <a href=https://www.videolan.org/vlc/>the main VLC installer</a>) is required for watching.
	<ul>
		<li><a class=eyecatcher href=vlc.html#multicast>Multicast RTP (recommended)</a> – <b>most efficient</b> in the Selfnet intranet
		<li><a class=eyecatcher href=vlc.html#unicast>Unicast HTTP</a> – if you are in a <b>wireless network</b> or if you can't receive multicast
	</ul>

	<h2>SAP Stream List</h2>
	<p>This works in all players that support SAP session discovery (<a href=http://www.videolan.org/vlc/>VLC</a> or <a href=http://xbmc.org/download/>XBMC</a>, please tell us if you know any others).
	<ol>
		<li>Download and install <a href=https://www.videolan.org/vlc/>VLC media player</a>. If you already have VLC installed, make sure you are using the newest version.
		<li>Activate the playlist view:<br>
			<a href=img/vlc_step1.png rel=lightbox[vlc]><img alt="View→Playlist" src=img/vlc_step1.png class=thumbnail></a>
		<li>Scroll down to "Local Network" and click on "Network streams (SAP)":<br>
			<a href=img/vlc_step2.png rel=lightbox[vlc]><img alt="" src=img/vlc_step2.png class=thumbnail></a><br>
			You should see the stream list getting filled.
		<li>If you are using VLC 2.1.0 or newer, you can see additional information by enabling the "Description" column in the stream list:<br>
			<a href=img/vlc_step3.png rel=lightbox[vlc]><img alt="right-click on the list header" src=img/vlc_step3.png class=thumbnail></a>
		<li>When you double-click on a stream, it should start playing within a few seconds.
	</ol>

	<h2>Static Playlists</h2>
	<p>If neither the in-browser nor the SAP stream lists work for you, you can download a static playlist of all current streams. <b>This is a fallback. Please use this only if the above stream lists do not work for you.</b> The stream addresses may change at any time!
	<p>Playlist format (if unsure, use M3U):
		<button type=button id=m3u-button>M3U</button>
		<button type=button id=xspf-button>XSPF</button>
		<br>
		<span id=progress-span></span><a href=# id=playlist-download-link style=display:none></a>

	<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Wireless networks deal badly with multicast. Use the HTTP-tunneled unicast streams instead. Even then, the streams may buffer very slowly, depending on your signal quality.
		<li>If you are using a router in your room and would like to use the multicast streams, you need to configure two UDP port forwardings: one for the video streams on port 1234 and one for the SAP stream on port 9875. (In your router, not at My.Selfnet.)
		<li>Bad weather can decrease satellite signal quality. To check for thunderstorms, google "weather in Stuttgart, Germany" or go outside.
		<li>Virtual network interfaces (by VirtualBox, VMware, Hamachi, VPN, ...) can confuse VLC.
		<li>If something used to work for you and now it doesn't, check our Twitter account <a target=_blank href=https://twitter.com/Selfnet_eV>@Selfnet_eV</a> for recent announcements.
		<li>Our <a href=http://www.selfnet.de/netzwerk/dienste/selfstreaming/>main website</a> also has some information about this service.
		<li>Sometimes, small groups of channels fail. In this case, please notify us.
	</ul>
	<p>If you are still having trouble, <a href=mailto:support@selfnet.de>send us an email</a>. Make sure to describe when and how you attempted to watch the streams (SAP stream list in VLC, VLC with static playlist or this website; unicast or multicast; wireless or wired connection; which channel; etc.)

	<h2>How It Works</h2>
	<p>We receive DVB-S and DVB-S2 satellite TV using a fairly large but otherwise standard dish sitting on top of our Vaihingen office. The dish is directed at the Astra satellites at 19.2°E. Currently, we only receive unscrambled transponders (multiplexed bundles of channels). The transponder streams are sent to a server running a patched version of <a href=https://www.videolan.org/projects/dvblast.html>dvblast</a>. The software remuxes them into separate MPEG-TS streams, encapsulates them in RTP, and sends them out on multicast IP addresses. Multicast enables a single IP packet to be received by multiple destinations. Some clients cannot receive multicast, so we also run <a href=http://www.udpxy.com/index-en.html>udpxy</a> to proxy them over HTTP. We don't transcode the actual video or audio data itself, so you are getting the best quality possible.
